# Automation with Tableau Server Client
Use these "nearly-ready-to-run" python (.py) files/scripts corresponding to each of my Tableau Server Client tutorials featured on my YouTube channel to save time and hundreds, if not thousands of clicks through automation.

1. Getting Started
   - Learn to authenticate and sign-in to your Tableau Server or Tableau Cloud instance for the first time. Updates to the token value are required unless you are also using the keyring module to store and retrieve your personal access tokens.

2. Generating Reports
   - Use these scripts to automate the generation of reports on various content and object types (e.g., flows, users, workbooks, data sources, etc.).

3. Refreshing Data
   - Automate the execution of flows, linked tasks, and extract refreshes on your Tableau Server or Tableau Cloud instance using these scripts.
