# Day Zero Project Hierarchy
Today is the day. Your team is standing up their Tableau Server in preparation for next week’s global roll-out. One of the tasks you have been assigned is to create a series of projects (i.e., folders) on the server that aligns with the organizational structure.

The organization’s structure consists of the following five regions, North America, Brazil, UK&I, Spanish Latam, EMEA, and APAC. Each of those regions is comprised of nine divisions, Marketing, Sales, Technology, Operations, Finance, Customer Support, Product, Legal, and Human Resources.

Use the Tableau Server Client (TSC) python library to create the organizational structure, programattically. Start off by creating a "DataDevQuest Challenge" project. This is the project where the new organizational structure will be maintained within. Upon completing the challenge, the DataDevQuest Challenge project hierarchy should look like the following:
